The model shows that neglecting the overlap between income and fuel poverty underestimates the metrics for the change in income poverty due to increases in carbon taxes. The model is parametrized using econometric methods. Being a single adult with dependent children, having low education levels, low income levels and having darkness or dampness in the dwelling increases the probability of being fuel poor. The estimates show that an 1% increase in carbon taxes will raise the number of people experiencing fuel poverty by 0.5%. It is also shown that while increases in lump-sum transfers are progressive, increases in energy prices and energy required to heat a dwelling are regressive. Among poor households, fuel poor households have the lowest income levels, have issues with dampness, and it is less likely that they have double glazing in their dwellings compared to other income poor households.

For instance instruments that tackle income poverty comprises child benefits, social assistance benefits and income tax thresholds across Europe (see Leventi et al., 2019). While policies that address fuel poverty in Europe tend to addressenergy saving issues, they also include elements of affordability and income poverty. Kyprianou et al. (2019) argue that given the implementation of these instruments they could be losing track of improving energy efficiency levels. For instance, in Spain the social tariff is too focused on socioeconomic criteria that could lose track of tacklingenergy efficiency issues. Other policy instruments implemented in Europe comprise financial interventions, subsidies for the investment in energy efficiency measures, and tips and awareness campaigns. Examples of these policy instruments are fuel allowances and winter Fuel Payments implemented in Ireland and the UK. Problems with energy affordability, eligibility of social welfare and existence of households with a disabling illness are the criteria to qualify for retrofit grants in Europe. Homes Energy Efficiency Program for Scotland (HEEPS) and the Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme (BEWHS) are examples of these policies. Regarding information campaigns, in Germany the Caritas-Stromsparcheck programme provides information on energy saving actions to low income households.","The theoretical model developed here shows that increases in carbon taxes can increase poverty through different channels: current energy consumption, energy prices, the existing level of poverty and changes in the number of households experiencing fuel poverty. Understanding the distributional effects of environmental policies is therefore important for a better informed public debate and for the designof effective policies to counter negative distributional impacts. In this regard, it is shown that increases in lump-sum transfers and reductions in energy requirements can reduce poverty. Using supervised machine learning methods, it is found that income is a strong predictor of fuel poverty. Tenants, one-parent households, households experiencing dampness and with an ill member are more likely to experience fuel poverty. It is shown that fuel poor households are more likely to have low income levels.","10.13140/RG.2.2.24881.07529","Jonathan","No","","No","","Yes"

However, this practice leads to a concentration for wind park implementations in those areas where attractive payback options due to high wind regime.

It does so, by systematically examining the comparative importance of inequality aversion to optimal mitigation, time preference, catastrophic damage, and intragenerational distributions of damage and mitigation costs when computing optimal carbon price trajectories. It includes mechanisms to represent inequalities within regions and countries that are not included in other existing climate-economy IAMs. The study finds that when climate damages disproportionately harm the poor, when mitigation costs are not disproportionately paid by the poor, and when discounting is sufficiently high making effort at the optimum low; in these circumstances, increasing inequality aversion leads to faster optimal mitigation contrary to the assumptions by the Ramsey Equation on discounting. This ""Shelling Reversal"" is present in situations of a progressive distribution of abatement costs and a regressive distribution of climate damages.Furthermore, findings show potentially catastrophic damages having a larger effect on optimal policy when damages are proportional to income than when they fall more on the pooe. This is due to strong mitigation requirements for reasons independent of the potential for catastrophic damages, which prevents temperature from increasing to the point where the elevated damage function would be relevant.","CO2 Emissions","","None","","Global;Country-level (including comparisons);State/Region","this paper relies on a model with inequalities within regions and countries in which the distribution of mitigation cost and damages can be varied,","Present (eg. status quo assessment)","","POLICY: Discussion of necessary policy design to reach an aim, or assessment of policy impacts","","(Skip: Not applicable)","","Energy justice;Climate Justice"," we investigate the comparative importance of several factors—namely, time preference, inequality aversion, intraregional inequalities in the distribution of both damage and mitigation cost and the damage function.","None","","Discussed (focus of paper)","Not mentioned","Mentioned (eg.
