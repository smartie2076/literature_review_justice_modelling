The model shows that neglecting the overlap between income and fuel poverty underestimates the metrics for the change in income poverty due to increases in carbon taxes. The model is parametrized using econometric methods. Being a single adult with dependent children, having low education levels, low income levels and having darkness or dampness in the dwelling increases the probability of being fuel poor. The estimates show that an 1% increase in carbon taxes will raise the number of people experiencing fuel poverty by 0.5%. It is also shown that while increases in lump-sum transfers are progressive, increases in energy prices and energy required to heat a dwelling are regressive. Among poor households, fuel poor households have the lowest income levels, have issues with dampness, and it is less likely that they have double glazing in their dwellings compared to other income poor households. Income and fuel poverty are two distinctive problems that require different policy instruments. Policies need to address income and energy efficiency inequalities simultaneously to counteract the regressive effect of carbon taxes in Ireland.","Heating and Cooling;Buildings","","Ireland","","Households/Prosumers","special focus on poor & fuel poor households","Present (eg. status quo assessment);Near future (up to 10 years or duration of a single project)","","POLICY: Discussion of necessary policy design to reach an aim, or assessment of policy impacts","The theoretical model developed here shows that increases in carbon taxes can increase poverty through different channels: current energy consumption, energy prices, the existing level of poverty and changes in the number of households experiencing fuel poverty.

For instance instruments that tackle income poverty comprises child benefits, social assistance benefits and income tax thresholds across Europe (see Leventi et al., 2019). While policies that address fuel poverty in Europe tend to addressenergy saving issues, they also include elements of affordability and income poverty. Kyprianou et al. (2019) argue that given the implementation of these instruments they could be losing track of improving energy efficiency levels. For instance, in Spain the social tariff is too focused on socioeconomic criteria that could lose track of tacklingenergy efficiency issues. Other policy instruments implemented in Europe comprise financial interventions, subsidies for the investment in energy efficiency measures, and tips and awareness campaigns. Examples of these policy instruments are fuel allowances and winter Fuel Payments implemented in Ireland and the UK. Problems with energy affordability, eligibility of social welfare and existence of households with a disabling illness are the criteria to qualify for retrofit grants in Europe. Homes Energy Efficiency Program for Scotland (HEEPS) and the Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme (BEWHS) are examples of these policies. Regarding information campaigns, in Germany the Caritas-Stromsparcheck programme provides information on energy saving actions to low income households.","The theoretical model developed here shows that increases in carbon taxes can increase poverty through different channels: current energy consumption, energy prices, the existing level of poverty and changes in the number of households experiencing fuel poverty. Understanding the distributional effects of environmental policies is therefore important for a better informed public debate and for the designof effective policies to counter negative distributional impacts. In this regard, it is shown that increases in lump-sum transfers and reductions in energy requirements can reduce poverty. Using supervised machine learning methods, it is found that income is a strong predictor of fuel poverty. Tenants, one-parent households, households experiencing dampness and with an ill member are more likely to experience fuel poverty. It is shown that fuel poor households are more likely to have low income levels.","10.13140/RG.2.2.24881.07529","Jonathan","No","","No","","Yes",""

However, this practice leads to a concentration for wind park implementations in those areas where attractive payback options due to high wind regime. Hence, the pressure from non-regional investors on stakeholders is growing in those regions high in wind. Therefore, further efforts from research are needed to foster those factors which can increase regional acceptance. In addition it is certainly important to not only identify such factors but also learn from process dynamics, since conflicts often derive from a lack of communication and early planning participation [51].

It does so, by systematically examining the comparative importance of inequality aversion to optimal mitigation, time preference, catastrophic damage, and intragenerational distributions of damage and mitigation costs when computing optimal carbon price trajectories. It includes mechanisms to represent inequalities within regions and countries that are not included in other existing climate-economy IAMs. The study finds that when climate damages disproportionately harm the poor, when mitigation costs are not disproportionately paid by the poor, and when discounting is sufficiently high making effort at the optimum low; in these circumstances, increasing inequality aversion leads to faster optimal mitigation contrary to the assumptions by the Ramsey Equation on discounting. This ""Shelling Reversal"" is present in situations of a progressive distribution of abatement costs and a regressive distribution of climate damages. Furthermore, findings show potentially catastrophic damages having a larger effect on optimal policy when damages are proportional to income than when they fall more on the pooe. This is due to strong mitigation requirements for reasons independent of the potential for catastrophic damages, which prevents temperature from increasing to the point where the elevated damage function would be relevant.","CO2 Emissions","","None","","Global;Country-level (including comparisons);State/Region","this paper relies on a model with inequalities within regions and countries in which the distribution of mitigation cost and damages can be varied,","Present (eg. status quo assessment)","","POLICY: Discussion of necessary policy design to reach an aim, or assessment of policy impacts","","(Skip: Not applicable)","","Energy justice;Climate Justice"," we investigate the comparative importance of several factors—namely, time preference, inequality aversion, intraregional inequalities in the distribution of both damage and mitigation cost and the damage function.","None","","Discussed (focus of paper)","Not mentioned","Mentioned (eg.

In turn, access to renewable energies is important in that the higher the percentage of renewably sourced electricity in the energy mix, the greater the sustainability of the electricity system [19], thereby lowering the final kWh tariff [62]. The residential environment refers to the energy efficiency standards of buildings and households.","Spain","","State/Region","Thirdly, the HEVI is tested in the Spanish regional context","Present (eg. status quo assessment)","","POLICY: Discussion of necessary policy design to reach an aim, or assessment of policy impacts;SPATIALITY: Geospatial perspective","Moreover, the authors emphasize and argue that the four axes are of “a geographically embedded and contingent nature” [23] (p. 640), resulting in a clear spatial distribution of energy poverty and, therefore, of vulnerability to this energy poverty","Gas;Heating;Renewables","Market conditions include utility tariffs, in particular natural gas and electricity.

In the case of market conditions, the only indicators available are the tariffs for the two most commonly used types of energy: gas and electricity. Although from a theoretical perspective their inclusion in the model is essential, in the specific case of the Spanish provinces they do not allow for a distinction to be drawn between units, as tariffs are standard for the entire country. Despite this, we opted to include them, as the proposed model is intended for general application. Access to renewable energies was calculated by determining the percentage of renewable energies over the total energy production in each province. As for the residential environment, the aim was to determine building energy quality. Unfortunately, there is no energy quality indicator for all the homes registered in Spain. Although new constructions are required to meet certain energy efficiency standards [86,87], this variable is not available for all Spanish homes. In light of these circumstances, we decided to apply two proxies: newly built homes, which supposedly meet the aforementioned energy requirements and a home ownership indicator, included under the supposition that home owners are more disposed than lessees to take on major alteration and improvement work, such as energy efficiency improvements [18,20]. When considering the physical environment, annual hours of sunshine were used to calculate luminosity conditions and annual heating degree days for thermal conditions. The “heating degree day” variable reflects the “harshness” of the climate conditions and indicates the energy needs of a specific territory in order to face these conditions. Specifically, this indicator was taken as the annual sum of the positive daily variations between 20 ◦C (which guarantees comfort in the home) and the exterior temperature [66]. A low value for this variable indicates limited heating requirements and outside temperatures averaging around 20 ◦C, whilst a high value indicates elevated heating needs. Finally, in the case of the socio-economic environment, the sub-dimensions discussed in the theoretical background were taken into consideration. Two partial indicators were used in order to approach the incidence of vulnerable population according to the theoretical framework and the availability of data at provincial level. On the one hand, the economically vulnerable population was approached by using the unemployed population in relation to the total population [21]. On the other hand, the demographically vulnerable population (i.e., the population that is particularly sensitive to environmental conditions for biological reasons) was approached by using the over 65s [21] and under 16s, in relation to the total population. Furthermore, per capita production (an average economic capacity for provincial populations) was used to approach the second sub-dimension: the vulnerability gap.","Electricity tariff, Natural gas tariff, Access to renewable energies, Home ownership, New home, Heating degree day, Hours of sunshine, Unemployed, Under 16s and over 65s, Per capita income","","Household Energy Vulnerability Index (HEVI)","The synthetic indicator may adopt positive values for some units and negative values for others. In this sense, the index value will be positive, providing that the weaknesses exceed the strengths, and negative when the strengths exceed the weaknesses. As a result, the higher the synthetic indicator value of a particular region, the greater its household energy vulnerability.","No, but relevat content","Household Energy Vulnerability Index (HEVI) - A tool designed to quantify the abstract and multidimensional phenomenon of household energy vulnerability","Goal-Programming, Monte Carlo simulation","","Houseownership and rent;Building conditions;Age;Occupation;Income;Average consumer","","Electricity tariff, Natural gas tariff, Access to renewable energies, Home ownership, New home, Heating degree day, Hours of sunshine, Unemployed, Under 16s and over 65s, Per capita income","","Household Energy Vulnerability Index (HEVI), deviation variables in relation to aspiration levels for each indicator","","DISTRIBUTIONAL JUSTICE: Distribution of benefits from the energy sector and also the negatives.
