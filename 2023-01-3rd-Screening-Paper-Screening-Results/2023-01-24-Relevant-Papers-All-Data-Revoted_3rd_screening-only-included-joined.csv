Global income inequality and energy consumption inequality are related. High-income households consume more energy than low-income ones, and for different purposes. Here, we explore the global household energy consumption implications of global income redistribution. We show that global income inequality shapes not only inequalities of energy consumption but the quantity and composition of overall energy demand. Our results call for the inclusion of income distribution into energy system models, as well as into energy and climate policy.Technical summary. Despite a rapidly growing number of studies on the relationship between inequality and energy, there is little research estimating the effect of income redistribution on energy demand. We contribute to this debate by proposing a simple but granular and data-driven model of the global income distribution and of global household energy consumption. We isolate the effect of income distribution on household energy consumption and move beyond the assumption of aggregate income-energy elasticities. First, we model expenditure as a function of income. Second, we determine budget shares of expenditure for a variety of products and services by employing product-granular income elasticities of demand.

Predicting social acceptance is often difficult due to the long-term planning horizon for energy systems. It is therefore unclear which design requirements and policy guidelines need to be specified ex ante. We suggest an approach to anticipate social acceptance by identifying value conflicts embedded in sustainable heating systems in specific social settings. These value conflicts might cause a lack of social acceptance over time due to value change. We demonstrate this approach using a case of community-driven heating initiative in The Hague, the Netherlands. We identify value conflicts embedded in various sustainable heating systems using an agent-based model. We formulate scenarios of value change to understand the severity of resulting social acceptance issues and discuss suitable heating systems for the city district. The approach can be used to support the decision-making process of policymakers at the local level, even in situations of limited local expertise.",1.0,0.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,28.0,28.0,0,221,0.1266968325791855,True,True,True,True,True,True,False,False,False,True,True,3.0,False,False,True,,,9.0,3,False,False,5.0,4.0,3.0,12.0,True,0,False,0.0,False,0.0,0,False,0.0,0.0,True,12.0,True,12.0,"de Wildt, Tristan E.; Boijmans, Anne R.; Chappin, Emile J.

In many cases, the ambitions of energy projects go beyond mere electricity production and involve issues of energy justice, environmental awareness, and environmental citizenship. However. these aspirations are often forgotten during project assessments, or they fail to include local voices, especially those of women and other marginalized groups. Gender has been given little attention in the energy scholarship and especially during the post-implementation assessment of energy projects due to the belief that energy technologies are gender neutral and beneficial for the whole community. The present study, with a focus on two local energy projects with mixed ownership, challenges this notion. The two case studies are the islands of El Hierro in Spain and Tilos in Greece. A detailed survey based on a series of indicators drawn from the energy justice framework is used to evaluate women's perceptions.

In many cases, the ambitions of energy projects go beyond mere electricity production and involve issues of energy justice, environmental awareness, and environmental citizenship. However. these aspirations are often forgotten during project assessments, or they fail to include local voices, especially those of women and other marginalized groups. Gender has been given little attention in the energy scholarship and especially during the post-implementation assessment of energy projects due to the belief that energy technologies are gender neutral and beneficial for the whole community. The present study, with a focus on two local energy projects with mixed ownership, challenges this notion. The two case studies are the islands of El Hierro in Spain and Tilos in Greece. A detailed survey based on a series of indicators drawn from the energy justice framework is used to evaluate women's perceptions.

We formulate a generation expansion planning problem as a utility-maximization mixed-integer linear program and apply it to a case study analysis of a low-income country with limited electricity infrastructure. We focus our analysis on understanding how the optimal allocation of generation between centralized and distributed resources is impacted by stakeholder preferences toward equality and different budget levels. We find that a high preference for equality leads to lower overall electricity consumption levels, but improved electrification rates due to greater investment (300-750 km increase) in transmission infrastructure. If stakeholders move from a low to a high equality preference then they could see a 72-87% increase in energy access equality rating depending on the budget. Conversely, indifference to equality leads to higher overall consumption levels in urban areas but reduced electrification rates. This methodology can help decision makers evaluate the social trade-offs between improving energy access, reducing energy inequality and poverty, and increasing total electricity consumption when operating under budget constraints in their countries.",,,,,,,,,19,0,0,0.0,1,0,19,,,0306-2619,1872-9118,,WOS:000519517700017,,"Changing the policy paradigm: A benefit maximization approach to electricity planning in developing countriesAccess to electricity can lead to enhanced education, business, and healthcare opportunities.

We observe that biodiversity loss is driven by other planetary boundaries (land-use change and freshwater use), but also a social foundation (jobs, measured as vulnerable employment). The planetary boundaries of freshwater use and land use are also related: freshwater use is higher in urban centres than in rural areas. The planetary boundary of climate change is also related to land use (the extent of agricultural lands), and the social foundation of income per capita (greater income, higher carbon dioxide emissions). We also find that several social foundations are themselves interrelated.

Solar and wind resources are presented as the two most promising alternatives in the future energy mix. However, the inherent fluctuations of these two resources jeopardize the stability of the grid. To overcome this issue, the combination of intermittent and non-intermittent renewable energies along with different storage technologies is proposed. In this work, the integration of these technologies is evaluated using different future scenarios. Three renewable resources have been analyzed (solar, wind, and biomass) in combination with four different storage systems (battery, hydrogen, methane, and ammonia). This problem has been evaluated from two different perspectives, economic and social (for which a new indicator is developed). Particularly, this methodology is applied to Spain where different provinces have been assessed to implement these integrated facilities. The results show the paramount importance of using storage alternatives to satisfy the demand and to store energy seasonally.

Solar and wind resources are presented as the two most promising alternatives in the future energy mix. However, the inherent fluctuations of these two resources jeopardize the stability of the grid. To overcome this issue, the combination of intermittent and non-intermittent renewable energies along with different storage technologies is proposed. In this work, the integration of these technologies is evaluated using different future scenarios. Three renewable resources have been analyzed (solar, wind, and biomass) in combination with four different storage systems (battery, hydrogen, methane, and ammonia). This problem has been evaluated from two different perspectives, economic and social (for which a new indicator is developed). Particularly, this methodology is applied to Spain where different provinces have been assessed to implement these integrated facilities. The results show the paramount importance of using storage alternatives to satisfy the demand and to store energy seasonally. In economic terms, an average cost of electricity of about 100-200 (sic)/MWh is expected with a high influence of the ratios of wind and solar in the different locations and the selected storage alternatives.

This paper investigates whether income inequality in EU countries is correlated with energy poverty by one of its definitions: a household's inability to keep their home adequately warm. Using country-level data for all 28 EU countries for all years 2009-2017, I regress the percentage of households who cannot keep their home adequately warm, against a set of independent variables including: the Gini index as a measure of income inequality; GDP per capita; the number of heating degree days; and several other likely determinants of energy poverty. I find the Gini index, GDP per capita and the number of heating degree days to be persistently strong and statistically significant predictors of the percentage unable to heat their homes, while the effects of the Gini index increase disproportionately as this percentage increases.

Due to network segregation, programs that target relatively affluent agents can generate rapid increases in overall adoption levels but at the cost of increasing disparities in access to solar technology between rich and poor communities. These dynamics are explored through theoretical agent-based models of solar adoption within hypothetical social systems. The effectiveness of three types of solar incentive programs, the feed-in tariff, leasing programs, and seeding programs, is explored. Even though these programs promote rapid adoption in the short term, results demonstrate that network segregation can create serious distributional justice problems in the long term for some programs. The distributional justice effects are particularly severe with the feed-in tariff. Overall, this paper provides an illustration of how agent-based models may be used to evaluate and experiment with policy interventions in a virtual space, which enhances the scientific basis of policymaking.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0.0,0,0,3,,,1076-2787,1099-0526,,WOS:000458991500001,,"Equity of Incentives: Agent-Based Explorations of How Social Networks Influence the Efficacy of Programs to Promote Solar AdoptionAgent-based models are used to explore how social networks influence the effectiveness of governmental programs to promote the adoption of solar photovoltaics (solar PV) by residential households.
