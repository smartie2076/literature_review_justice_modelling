Our results show that non-white respondents were seven times less likely than white respondents to report having solar panels and renters were three times less likely than homeowners to report having solar panels. Interviews also reveal HTBs are available mostly to high-income households. We argue that these disparities may result from structural discrimination and policies that distribute HTBs to households with disposable income and property rights. The unequal distribution of this 'investment capital' prevents widespread access for non-white, low-income, and renting households. Following an anti-resilience framework, we propose alternative policy frameworks that center justice within energy transition policy making.",8.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,32.0,32.0,0,203,0.1576354679802955,True,True,True,True,True,True,False,False,True,True,True,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,8.0,5.0,True,False,False,True

To achieve the low-carbon transition, financial incentives such as carbon trading are employed in the electricity and natural gas sectors to encourage flexibly emission mitigation to cover the extra carbon costs. However, the existing trading policy applies unilateral mechanism, carbon costs are usually levied on power generation and gas supply companies. Utility companies would simply pass-through the carbon costs to consumers by incorporating them into upward energy prices. Further, due to more than one form of energy consumption in integrated components, there are twofold charges of carbon costs for some consumers in IES.

To achieve the low-carbon transition, financial incentives such as carbon trading are employed in the electricity and natural gas sectors to encourage flexibly emission mitigation to cover the extra carbon costs. However, the existing trading policy applies unilateral mechanism, carbon costs are usually levied on power generation and gas supply companies. Utility companies would simply pass-through the carbon costs to consumers by incorporating them into upward energy prices.

Hence, they do not facilitate effective measurement of progress towards sustainable energy development for individual nations. Important issues relating to energy affordability and equity, environmental sustainability, efficiency, energy security and renewables are neglected by the indicators in all cases, although it should be said that the IAEA indicators are more comprehensive in their coverage of energy efficiency, renewables and environmental sustainability. In each case the indicators are at best only partially relevant to the Icelandic case, due to the country's unique energy mix, environment, economic structure and size and standard of living. By identifying their limitations and by examining them in light of criteria for good indicators as recommended by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD), we contribute to the discussion on the value and validity of indicators, indices and frameworks.

Important issues relating to energy affordability and equity, environmental sustainability, efficiency, energy security and renewables are neglected by the indicators in all cases, although it should be said that the IAEA indicators are more comprehensive in their coverage of energy efficiency, renewables and environmental sustainability. In each case the indicators are at best only partially relevant to the Icelandic case, due to the country's unique energy mix, environment, economic structure and size and standard of living. By identifying their limitations and by examining them in light of criteria for good indicators as recommended by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD), we contribute to the discussion on the value and validity of indicators, indices and frameworks. Knowing the potential pitfalls, we are in a better position to design a more effective measurement tool. We conclude that a more comprehensive, multi-level, context-specific measurement tool would be needed for measuring national energy sustainability in Iceland and would require methods that allow broad public participation.

The studies presented in this special issue illustrate that the field of energy justice is a rapidly growing arena. There is constant innovation taking place in enabling the transition with new structures, processes and metrics being introduced to guide decision-making and a more holistic view of the community emerging where acceptance, mobilisation and empowerment are opening possibilities for a just transition to a low carbon energy system.

This study uses the concept of energy justice and an interdisciplinary spatial assessment of potential environmental risks arising from shale gas developments, to evaluate where injustices may emerge, using the Vale of Pickering as a case study.A novel methodology was used to model a possible scenario of shale gas developments, including the spatial dimensions of air and water pollution, seismicity and traffic flows, which were combined to generate an overall environmental risk assessment. This was analysed with a metric of socio-economic vulnerability, to highlight social groups which may be disproportionately at risk from fracking.

Understanding the factors that influence energy transitions at a household level, is essential for successful strategies to promote the uptake of cleaner fuels and deliver associated socio-economic benefits. Such fast-growing cities often display intra-urban inequalities of considerable magnitude which can condition individual access to resources and impact the effectiveness of energy provision strategies for individual city districts. In this paper we will use the results of a survey of 500 households in Bangalore, India and explore how this data compares with the `wave concept' model of energy transition.

Understanding the factors that influence energy transitions at a household level, is essential for successful strategies to promote the uptake of cleaner fuels and deliver associated socio-economic benefits. Such fast-growing cities often display intra-urban inequalities of considerable magnitude which can condition individual access to resources and impact the effectiveness of energy provision strategies for individual city districts. In this paper we will use the results of a survey of 500 households in Bangalore, India and explore how this data compares with the `wave concept' model of energy transition.

Analysing the opportunities and justice issues within positive energy districts in EuropeThe current energy transition focuses on decarbonisation through the use of renewable energy sources, coupled with improvements in efficiency by means of technological innovations. However, there is also a clear call for realizing a just transition. The implementation of smart technology-led transitions and low-carbon energy system innovations is increasingly urged to become more people-centred by taking energy poverty and other justice related issues into account. Energy justice and energy poverty debates already transcend narrow foci on income and energy expenditure ratios and have moved towards multidimensional approaches (Bouzarovski and Petrova, 2015) [1]. In addition, the capability approach (CA) has been used to understand energy deprivation (Day et al., 2016) [2]. We further develop these approaches to better understand justice relevant issues within Positive Energy Districts, especially by looking at how opportunity spaces for realizing wellbeing are created.

This study formulates an interval decision matrix to apply Principal Components Analysis (PCA) by reducing a large set into a small set of underlying variables with comprehensive information. Finally, this study uses the Fuzzy-TOPSIS method to determine the comprehensive ranks of all countries.

In contrast, Germany has dominated all top ten performers by energy and environmental progress, which cannot be shirker within the UK's social progress concept.

Among them, the clean energy transformation is very crucial. This study evaluates the impact of a set of policies including the development of renewable energy, upgrading heavy industry, and energy efficiency improvement on China's income gap between 2012 and 2050. A dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model with detailed representations of economic activity, an upgraded labor market and disaggregated labor types based on statistical and survey data is used. Our research provides support for the necessity of low-carbon policies to achieve NDC targets. Results show some key findings. First, low-carbon policies have the greatest impact on employment across all energy industries, with negative impacts in most traditional energy sectors and positive impacts in most renewable power sectors. Second, labor will continue to migrate from rural to urban areas with the transformation of the economic structure and the urbanization rate will further increase, reaching a maximum of around 70%.

Among them, the clean energy transformation is very crucial. This study evaluates the impact of a set of policies including the development of renewable energy, upgrading heavy industry, and energy efficiency improvement on China's income gap between 2012 and 2050. A dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model with detailed representations of economic activity, an upgraded labor market and disaggregated labor types based on statistical and survey data is used. Our research provides support for the necessity of low-carbon policies to achieve NDC targets. Results show some key findings. First, low-carbon policies have the greatest impact on employment across all energy industries, with negative impacts in most traditional energy sectors and positive impacts in most renewable power sectors. Second, labor will continue to migrate from rural to urban areas with the transformation of the economic structure and the urbanization rate will further increase, reaching a maximum of around 70%. The reduction of the rural population will bring new opportunities for the modernization of agriculture, increasing the income of rural residents and realizing the equitable development between urban and rural areas.

205,J,"Semieniuk, G.; Yakovenko, V.M.",,,,,,,,Historical evolution of global inequality in carbon emissions and footprints versus redistributive scenarios [arXiv],,,,,,,,arXiv,,,,,,,,26 pp.,26 pp.,,,,,,29 March 2020,2020,"Ambitious scenarios of carbon emission redistribution for mitigating climate change in line with the Paris Agreement and reaching the sustainable development goal of eradicating poverty have been proposed recently. They imply a strong reduction in carbon footprint inequality by 2030 that effectively halves the Gini coefficient to about 0.25. This paper examines feasibility of these scenarios by analyzing the historical evolution of both weighted international inequality in CO2 emissions attributed territorially and global inequality in carbon footprints attributed to end consumers. For the latter, a new dataset is constructed that is more comprehensive than existing ones. In both cases, we find a decreasing trend in global inequality, partially attributed to the move of China from the lower to the middle part of the distribution, with footprints more unequal than territorial emissions. These results show that realization of the redistributive scenarios would require an unprecedented reduction in global inequality far below historical levels. Moreover, the territorial emissions data, available for more recent years up to 2017, show a saturation of the decreasing Gini coefficient at a level of 0.5.

They imply a strong reduction in carbon footprint inequality by 2030 that effectively halves the Gini coefficient to about 0.25. This paper examines feasibility of these scenarios by analyzing the historical evolution of both weighted international inequality in CO2 emissions attributed territorially and global inequality in carbon footprints attributed to end consumers. For the latter, a new dataset is constructed that is more comprehensive than existing ones. In both cases, we find a decreasing trend in global inequality, partially attributed to the move of China from the lower to the middle part of the distribution, with footprints more unequal than territorial emissions. These results show that realization of the redistributive scenarios would require an unprecedented reduction in global inequality far below historical levels. Moreover, the territorial emissions data, available for more recent years up to 2017, show a saturation of the decreasing Gini coefficient at a level of 0.5. This observation confirms an earlier prediction based on maximal entropy reasoning that the Lorenz curve converges to the exponential distribution. This saturation further undermines feasibility of the redistributive scenarios, which are also hindered by structural tendencies that reinforce carbon footprint inequality under global capitalism.

It is found that an important challenge for CES systems is to realise the value of the shared electricity equitably amongst the participants and potentially to seek other revenue streams.",7.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,24.0,24.0,0,246,0.0975609756097561,True,True,True,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,True,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,5.0,False,False,False,False

Tremendous financial subsidies have been provided by city and central governments. This new heating mode changed the heating fee-cost to residents. This paper estimates the economic costs to both governments and residents, and evaluates the environmental and public health benefits by combining a difference-in-differences model with an exposure-response function. Results show that the total costs of clean heating were up to 43.1 billion yuan. Governments and residents account for 44% and 56% of the total costs, respectively. In terms of benefits, the clean heating project is effective for air pollution control and brings health economic benefits of about 109.85 billion yuan (95% CI: 22.40-159.83). The clean heating policy was identified as a net-positive benefit program with environmental and public health improvements.

We find that the transition to more modern energy services is far from gender neutral: despite providing broad benefits within the community, the benefits derived from a new technology and service were not evenly distributed between men and women due to broader socio-cultural practices and norms. This paper extends the application of the Energy Cultures Framework in two important ways. Firstly, it incorporates an explicit gender dimension into the framework. Secondly, it applies the framework in a new context - rural energy transitions in low-income countries. In doing so, this paper offers important insights for research and practice in energy, gender and development.",9.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,22.0,22.0,0,237,0.0928270042194092,True,True,True,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,True,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,False,False,False,False

It provides data about the rural energy efficiency gap and identifies barriers to energy efficiency in rural communities. It also highlights strategies that are helping to bridge the gap by making it easier for residents in cold climate, petroleum-dependent states-those with high thermal energy burdens-to increase comfort and safety in their homes while also reducing energy bills. The barriers to rural energy efficiency identified in this paper have been grouped into three categories: geographic barriers, financial barriers, and awareness and access barriers. There are many differences between rural areas across the country, e.g., demographics, utility model and rate structures, energy sources, and consumption patterns. This paper is not intended to suggest that the strategies documented here will necessarily be applicable to all rural areas in the USA",19.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,31.0,31.0,0,338,0.0917159763313609,True,True,True,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,True,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,9.0,5.0,False,False,False,True

However, the quantitative measurement of energy vulnerability is still an unexplored field of research. In this paper, the Vulnerability Index is developed, which, based on stochastic analysis, quantifies the vulnerability of a population to the energy poverty ratio, compared to a reference population. Moreover, Sensitivity Analysis quantifies the particular contribution of various parameters to the problem, by determining their weighting factors. As case study, the vulnerability of Greek mountainous regions with respect to the country level was studied. The results showed that households living in mountainous regions are more vulnerable versus those of the whole country, at 89.7%. It was also found that energy policy should focus on raising incomes of mountainous population and, afterwards, on energy saving measures and reduction of heating cost in mountains. The methodology suggested can address social inequalities of vulnerable population groups, in terms of energy poverty. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, the quantitative measurement of energy vulnerability is still an unexplored field of research. In this paper, the Vulnerability Index is developed, which, based on stochastic analysis, quantifies the vulnerability of a population to the energy poverty ratio, compared to a reference population. Moreover, Sensitivity Analysis quantifies the particular contribution of various parameters to the problem, by determining their weighting factors. As case study, the vulnerability of Greek mountainous regions with respect to the country level was studied. The results showed that households living in mountainous regions are more vulnerable versus those of the whole country, at 89.7%. It was also found that energy policy should focus on raising incomes of mountainous population and, afterwards, on energy saving measures and reduction of heating cost in mountains. The methodology suggested can address social inequalities of vulnerable population groups, in terms of energy poverty. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The current standard metric Total Primary Energy Supply of a country does not take into account the energy embodied in goods and services imported from other countries, leading to the perverse outcome of a country appearing to be more sustainable the more it outsources its energy-intensive industries. Academia has addressed this problem by suggesting the use of the Total Primary Energy Footprint as an additional metric, but there has not been a clear proposal put forward by academia to governments or international institutions about how to officially adopt Consumption-Based Accounting in the field of energy. This article states that acknowledging the existence of embodied energy flows is indispensable when formulating new national and international energy policies for the transition towards energy systems that are socially and environmentally more sustainable. In this study, the Hidden Energy Flow indicator of 44 countries has been quantified using, for the first time, five different Global Multi-Regional Input-Output databases for the latest available year, 2011. The proposed indicator provides a percentage to be added to or subtracted from the Total Primary Energy Used value of a country, provided by the International Energy Agency, to get its real consumption-based energy requirement. This study demonstrates that, from 44 countries analysed, the ten most developed countries demand on average 18.5% more energy than measured by the International Energy Agency; the medium developed 24 countries demand 12.4% more, and the ten least developed countries demand 1.6% less. This means that most developed and medium developed countries displace their indirect energy consumption towards less developed countries in a hidden way. Furthermore, this research supports evidence that direct energy consumption in households is less relevant than the energy embodied in goods and services purchased by households, reaching 59.1% in the case of Switzerland, used as a reference among developed countries. The proposed Hidden Energy Flow indicator supports scientists, policymakers and citizens in the effort to focus the energy transition actions towards conducting the necessary energy consumption and production changes in the most effective way, improving energy justice and energy democracy.

Academia has addressed this problem by suggesting the use of the Total Primary Energy Footprint as an additional metric, but there has not been a clear proposal put forward by academia to governments or international institutions about how to officially adopt Consumption-Based Accounting in the field of energy. This article states that acknowledging the existence of embodied energy flows is indispensable when formulating new national and international energy policies for the transition towards energy systems that are socially and environmentally more sustainable. In this study, the Hidden Energy Flow indicator of 44 countries has been quantified using, for the first time, five different Global Multi-Regional Input-Output databases for the latest available year, 2011. The proposed indicator provides a percentage to be added to or subtracted from the Total Primary Energy Used value of a country, provided by the International Energy Agency, to get its real consumption-based energy requirement. This study demonstrates that, from 44 countries analysed, the ten most developed countries demand on average 18.5% more energy than measured by the International Energy Agency; the medium developed 24 countries demand 12.4% more, and the ten least developed countries demand 1.6% less. This means that most developed and medium developed countries displace their indirect energy consumption towards less developed countries in a hidden way. Furthermore, this research supports evidence that direct energy consumption in households is less relevant than the energy embodied in goods and services purchased by households, reaching 59.1% in the case of Switzerland, used as a reference among developed countries. The proposed Hidden Energy Flow indicator supports scientists, policymakers and citizens in the effort to focus the energy transition actions towards conducting the necessary energy consumption and production changes in the most effective way, improving energy justice and energy democracy.

We illustrate several hypothesis-based relationships here, to suggest that everything is not related to everything else. It is possible to work out significant pathways within this complex system, which is necessary to implement policies.A free Plain Language Summary can be found within the Supporting Information of this article.A free Plain Language Summary can be found within the Supporting Information of this article.",1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,30.0,30.0,0,367,0.0817438692098092,True,True,True,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,True,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,9.0,5.0,True,True,False,True

Our multi-model mean estimate for the SC-CH4 is US$933 per tonne of CH4 (5-95 per cent range, US$471-1,570 per tonne of CH4) under a high-emissions scenario (Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5), a 22 per cent decrease compared to estimates based on the climate uncertainty framework used by the US federal government(5).

We also show that our SC-CH4 estimates are sensitive to model combinations; for example, within one IAM, different methane cycle sub-models can induce variations of approximately 20 per cent in the estimated SC-CH4. But switching IAMs can more than double the estimated SC-CH4. Extending our results to account for societal concerns about equity produces SC-CH4 estimates that differ by more than an order of magnitude between low- and high-income regions. Our central equity-weighted estimate for the USA increases to US$8,290 per tonne of CH4 whereas our estimate for sub-Saharan Africa decreases to US$134 per tonne of CH4.",0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,23.0,23.0,0,304,0.0756578947368421,True,True,True,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,True,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,False,False,False,True

Within unequal societies, such as South Africa, a reliance on technical solutions to address access and inequality is inadequate, leading to resistance and protest. Further, introduction of a technical solution - such as solar PV - to address energy access in urban informal settlements, is a complex process, and requires a systems thinking perspective. Using Community Based System Dynamics modelling, this paper therefore investigated the issues that affect energy fuel choice and energy access as related to the introduction of a renewable energy solution in Enkanini informal settlement. Different energy user groups were engaged in the identification of the factors that affect energy access and energy fuel choice: the relationships between these factors in order to improve future interventions: and development of causal loop diagrams to visualise the key feedback loops. The identified factors were economic and market related such as affordability, availability, and land ownership but also included a range of socio-political aspects. 17 feedback loops emerged, of which 13 were reinforcing loops, and 4 were balancing loops. The key feedback loops relate to community empowerment and representation, whilst participation in the political process and the quest for legitimacy through direct electricity connections were recognised as broader issues to be addressed.

Within unequal societies, such as South Africa, a reliance on technical solutions to address access and inequality is inadequate, leading to resistance and protest. Further, introduction of a technical solution - such as solar PV - to address energy access in urban informal settlements, is a complex process, and requires a systems thinking perspective. Using Community Based System Dynamics modelling, this paper therefore investigated the issues that affect energy fuel choice and energy access as related to the introduction of a renewable energy solution in Enkanini informal settlement. Different energy user groups were engaged in the identification of the factors that affect energy access and energy fuel choice: the relationships between these factors in order to improve future interventions: and development of causal loop diagrams to visualise the key feedback loops. The identified factors were economic and market related such as affordability, availability, and land ownership but also included a range of socio-political aspects. 17 feedback loops emerged, of which 13 were reinforcing loops, and 4 were balancing loops. The key feedback loops relate to community empowerment and representation, whilst participation in the political process and the quest for legitimacy through direct electricity connections were recognised as broader issues to be addressed.

The deficit score was designed and used as a tool for identifying environmental, energy, and health vulnerabilities while the asset score was used to identify possible relief from these neighbourhood deficits. The design and use of these scores were the result of a collaboration between a community group, Chispa Arizona, and re-Engineered, a research laboratory at Arizona State University. The neighbourhood deficit score (NDS) aggregates a number of phenomena inclusive of: environmental burdens (such as criteria air pollutants and incidence of asthma), socio-economic variables (that may exacerbate the impacts of environmental burdens), and energy poverty. In contrast, the neighbourhood asset score (NAS) assembles a range of community assets (like churches, schools, parks, and grocery stores) which residents might leverage to ameliorate intersectional deficits.

The design and use of these scores were the result of a collaboration between a community group, Chispa Arizona, and re-Engineered, a research laboratory at Arizona State University. The neighbourhood deficit score (NDS) aggregates a number of phenomena inclusive of: environmental burdens (such as criteria air pollutants and incidence of asthma), socio-economic variables (that may exacerbate the impacts of environmental burdens), and energy poverty. In contrast, the neighbourhood asset score (NAS) assembles a range of community assets (like churches, schools, parks, and grocery stores) which residents might leverage to ameliorate intersectional deficits.

Based on data from a comprehensive survey of more than 2200 citizens, the empirical analysis reveals that the polluter pays rule has by far the highest support compared with the ability-to-pay rule and especially compared with the equal-pay rule, which is widely refused in the sample. Since the distribution of the costs of the German energy transition is largely in line with a polluter-pays rule, its strong support seems to contribute to the high acceptance of the energy transition at all. The main result of our econometric analysis with multivariate binary and ordered probit models is that not only some attitudinal factors like environmental values and political identification, but especially economic self-interest is relevant since (equivalent) energy expenditures have a significantly negative effect on the support of the polluter-pays rule and especially (equivalent) income has a significantly negative effect on the preference for the ability-to-pay rule. These results suggest that the use of distributional arguments for the criticism of energy policy measures is not necessarily value-driven on the basis of real perceptions of distributive justice, but can also be strategically motivated to prevent and combat economically unfavorable measures.

The practical usefulness of sustainability as a moral framework is highlighted by demonstrating how it is applicable for understanding intergenerational dilemmas-between present and future generations, but also among different future generations-related to nuclear fuel cycles and radioactive waste management.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,10.0,0,138,0.072463768115942,True,True,True,True,True,True,False,False,True,False,True,2.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,9.0,5.0,False,False,False,False

The estimates show that an 1% increase in carbon taxes will raise the number of people experiencing fuel poverty by 0.5%. It is also shown that while increases in lump-sum transfers are progressive, increases in energy prices and energy required to heat a dwelling are regressive. Among poor households, fuel poor households have the lowest income levels, have issues with dampness, and it is less likely that they have double glazing in their dwellings compared to other income poor households. Income and fuel poverty are two distinctive problems that require different policy instruments.

Australia also expects to follow the international pathways to implement a climate change policy to curb its greenhouse gas emissions. In this context, the former Labor Government in Australia intended to switch its carbon tax policy to an emissions trading scheme (ETS) after 2 years of its initial operation to achieve an emission target of 5 per cent below the 2000 level by 2020. By employing a computable general equilibrium model and a social accounting matrix database, this article analyses the potential impacts of an ETS with various revenue recycling options on Australian households. Results show that an emission permit price of A$20 per tonne of CO2-e would help Australia to achieve the 2020 emission reduction target. This permit price is likely to have a small contraction in Australia's real GDP (i.e. about 0.3 per cent) and in real household consumption (i.e. about 0.19 per cent).

Australia also expects to follow the international pathways to implement a climate change policy to curb its greenhouse gas emissions. In this context, the former Labor Government in Australia intended to switch its carbon tax policy to an emissions trading scheme (ETS) after 2 years of its initial operation to achieve an emission target of 5 per cent below the 2000 level by 2020. By employing a computable general equilibrium model and a social accounting matrix database, this article analyses the potential impacts of an ETS with various revenue recycling options on Australian households. Results show that an emission permit price of A$20 per tonne of CO2-e would help Australia to achieve the 2020 emission reduction target. This permit price is likely to have a small contraction in Australia's real GDP (i.e. about 0.3 per cent) and in real household consumption (i.e. about 0.19 per cent).

Focusing on a case study of England, this paper analyses the geographical distribution of DEP and TEP, and the extent to which the two intersect. Two neighbourhood-scale analyses shed light on the geographies of DEV, using three existing DEP and TEP indicators. Firstly, we identify significant clusters of neighbourhoods with a high or low propensity to DEV using a Local Moran's I statistic. Secondly, we identify neighbourhoods in the highest and lowest quantiles for multiple DEP and TEP indicators. Our results illustrate that as many as 6% of neighbourhoods (accounting for 3 million residents) have a high propensity towards DEV depending on the indicators selected, typically concentrating in isolated, rural neighbourhoods. We discuss our findings in light of the role that lack of access to networked energy and transport infrastructures plays in aggravating energy poverty in both domains. The findings support a cross-sectoral policy approach to tackle the issue of DEV.",11.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,18.0,18.0,0,270,0.0666666666666666,True,True,True,True,True,True,False,False,True,False,True,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,9.0,5.0,False,False,False,False

Therefore, there are a lack of micro scale policies and further in-depth research is needed based on the multivariable complexity of social justice. In this context, public housing policies have a challenge in order to meet not only the right to housing but also an affordable and comfortable use. The intention of this research is to develop an index to help the decision-making process in the early stages of social housing allocation. The analyses were based on the applicability of adaptive comfort, urban context and building features, considering energy use and the ability to pay utility bills.

Food harvested from the local environment (i.e. subsistence) was necessary to include in security assessments given that 24% of participants reported insecurity when asked about contemporary sources (i.e. purchased) versus 5% reporting insecurity for subsistence food sources (i.e., harvested). The major influences on FEW security tended to originate from outside the community, including factors such as transportation, income, fuel prices, and weather.

Communication about RE projects was key to managing expectations, promoting knowledge, and identifying benefits for residents. Participants did not identify linkages between RE and FEW security.

The Denver region is an instructive case study of the FEW nexus for multiple reasons: it is rapidly growing, is semi-arid, faces a large projected water shortfall, and is a major fossil fuel and agricultural producer. The rapid uptake of high-volume hydraulic fracturing (HVHF) combined with horizontal drilling in populated areas poses ongoing risks to regional water quality. Through this case study, fracking is identified as a major topic for FEW nexus inquiry, with intensifying impacts on water quantity and quality that reflect nationwide trends. Key data gaps are also identified, including energy for water use and food preparation. This case study is relevant to water and sustainability planners, energy regulators, communities impacted by hydraulic fracturing, and consumers of energy and food produced in the Denver region. It is applicable beyond Denver to dry areas with growing populations, agricultural activity, and the potential for shale development.",6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,15.0,15.0,0,263,0.0570342205323193,True,True,True,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,True,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,False,False,True,False

For example, the California government directly returns ETS revenue to residents through electricity bill credits, as well as dedicated some of the revenue to the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF). This study uses a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to explore the economic impact of directly returning the revenue from the ETS to residents in China.

The results indicate that IDR follows hyperbolic time-decline, and a considerable share of respondents (around 20%) are willing to treat future generations as equally important in the case of human lives, while this proportion for monetary gains is two times lower. The IDR drivers differ between lives and money in respect of socioeconomic profile and attitude characteristics as well as between intragenerational and intergenerational time frames. The findings support (a) the rationale for distinct treatment of intergenerational allocations, (b) the divergence of preferences between public and private impacts, and (c) the switch from single to declining discount rate regime in Poland.",1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,7.0,0,280,0.025,True,True,True,True,True,True,False,False,True,False,True,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,5.0,True,False,False,True

Around the world, individuals, communities, organizations, cities, states, and countries are recognizing that renewable energy offers much more than just reliable clean electricity, pollution reductions, and climate mitigation. In addition to these environmental benefits, the renewable energy revolution also provides potential to transform society by redistributing jobs, wealth, health, and political power more equitably. Energy democracy is a growing social movement that prioritizes this potential for redistributing power to the people through renewable transformation. Energy democracy acknowledges how fossil-fuel-based energy systems and the associated massive corporate profits of large multinational energy companies have perpetuated inequities, exacerbated disparate vulnerabilities, and promoted widespread injustices among and within communities around the world. By highlighting the negative societal impacts of fossil-fuel-based concentration of power and wealth, the principles of energy democracy connect energy system change with an associated transformation toward a more socially just and equal society. Energy democracy recognizes that replacing fossil-fuel-based infrastructure with renewables is much more than a technological substitution; the social changes associated with this transition could be transformative. Energy democracy focuses on harnessing this progressive social change potential by embracing a vision of more distributed, locally based energy systems with a regionally appropriate mix of different renewable sources satisfying 100% of society's energy needs. Whether the renewable energy transition delivers on this potential of redistributing power depends, however, on how renewable energy is deployed, and who is included and excluded in the benefits of a renewable-based society. The energy democracy vision, therefore, provides a valuable lens to guide participation, governance, and priorities of the renewable energy revolution. Advancing the vision of the energy democracy movement requires prioritizing local and community-controlled renewables and scaling-up and mainstreaming cooperative-model, publicly owned energy infrastructure.",,,,,,,,,43,0,0,0.0,4,0,43,,,0013-9157,1939-9154,,WOS:000458554100002,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1,,True,True,True,True,False,True,False,True,True,False,True,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,4.0,False,False,False,False
