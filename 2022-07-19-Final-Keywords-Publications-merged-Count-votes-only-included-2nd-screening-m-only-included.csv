Through a geospatial intersection of energy burden, environmental hazard, and sociodemographic data with technical generation potential and the levelized cost of energy for multiple renewable energy technologies, we calculated county-level correlations and identified trends across disadvantaged community indicators and renewable energy deployment potential. Data sources and tools included the Low-Income Energy Affordability Data (LEAD) tool, the Environmental Justice Screening and Mapping (EJSCREEN) tool, the State and Local Planning for Energy (SLOPE) platform, and the Renewable Energy Integration and Optimization (REopt (R)) model.

The Energy Justice Metric (EJM) quantifies energy justice through analyzing the energy justice performance of different countries utilising data from international institutions and national governments.

Similarly, renewable energy technologies are increasingly being promoted for their environmental and social benefits. However, little work has been done to systematically examine the extent to which, in what ways and in what contexts, renewable energy technologies can contribute to achieving energy justice. This paper assesses the potential of renewable electricity technologies to address energy justice in various global contexts via a systematic review of existing studies analyzed in terms of the principles and dimensions of energy justice. Based on publications including peer reviewed academic literature, books, and in some cases reports by government or international organizations, we assess renewable electricity technologies in both grid integrated and off-grid use contexts. We conduct our investigation through the rubric of the affirmative and prohibitive principles of energy justice and in terms of its temporal, geographic, socio-political, economic, and technological dimensions.

Household energy consumption is uncontrolled under the current policy both in the developed and developing countries, which is inefficient towards an ambitious climate target. Household participation in emission trading scheme (ETS) is a valuable solution. Enhancing understanding of socioeconomic impacts of the policy will facilitate the deployment and development on ground in the countries with ETS. The dynamic computable general equilibrium model with extended linear expenditure system and emission trading scheme, is used to analyze the impacts.

Nations and their governments must strive to implement energy policies that facilitate sustainable development for society. Although Iceland is highly ranked by currently available energy indices, controversy has surrounded the development of previously undeveloped areas for power development and Iceland now finds itself at a crossroads regarding future energy developments. Well-designed indices for measuring the sustainability of energy systems can help policy-makers make the best choices for their national circumstances. However, often indicators and indices suffer from limitations and it may not be advisable to implement indicators designed for global comparisons at local, regional or even national scales. Nonetheless, indices such as those developed by the World Economic Council (WEC), World Economic Forum (WEF) for ranking countries and indicator sets such as the International Atomic Energy Agency's Energy (IAEA) Energy Indicators for Sustainable Development (EISD) may still be useful guides to decision-makers when designing their own national measurement tools provided the indicators fulfil certain criteria. Through interviews with key energy practitioners and decision-makers in energy development in Iceland and an extensive literature review, we identify the challenges faced in sustainable energy development in Iceland. We assess the suitability of indices proposed by organisations like the WEC, WEF and IAEA for reliably measuring the sustainability of energy development in individual countries like Iceland. We find that the indices and indicators evaluated suffer from commonly cited limitations including lack of methodological transparency, misalignment with sustainable development principles, inappropriate metrics, lack of clear targets, failure to capture socio-ecological impacts at different scales and failure to meet the interest of the target audience. Hence, they do not facilitate effective measurement of progress towards sustainable energy development for individual nations. Important issues relating to energy affordability and equity, environmental sustainability, efficiency, energy security and renewables are neglected by the indicators in all cases, although it should be said that the IAEA indicators are more comprehensive in their coverage of energy efficiency, renewables and environmental sustainability. In each case the indicators are at best only partially relevant to the Icelandic case, due to the country's unique energy mix, environment, economic structure and size and standard of living. By identifying their limitations and by examining them in light of criteria for good indicators as recommended by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD), we contribute to the discussion on the value and validity of indicators, indices and frameworks. Knowing the potential pitfalls, we are in a better position to design a more effective measurement tool.

Nations and their governments must strive to implement energy policies that facilitate sustainable development for society. Although Iceland is highly ranked by currently available energy indices, controversy has surrounded the development of previously undeveloped areas for power development and Iceland now finds itself at a crossroads regarding future energy developments. Well-designed indices for measuring the sustainability of energy systems can help policy-makers make the best choices for their national circumstances. However, often indicators and indices suffer from limitations and it may not be advisable to implement indicators designed for global comparisons at local, regional or even national scales. Nonetheless, indices such as those developed by the World Economic Council (WEC), World Economic Forum (WEF) for ranking countries and indicator sets such as the International Atomic Energy Agency's Energy (IAEA) Energy Indicators for Sustainable Development (EISD) may still be useful guides to decision-makers when designing their own national measurement tools provided the indicators fulfil certain criteria. Through interviews with key energy practitioners and decision-makers in energy development in Iceland and an extensive literature review, we identify the challenges faced in sustainable energy development in Iceland. We assess the suitability of indices proposed by organisations like the WEC, WEF and IAEA for reliably measuring the sustainability of energy development in individual countries like Iceland. We find that the indices and indicators evaluated suffer from commonly cited limitations including lack of methodological transparency, misalignment with sustainable development principles, inappropriate metrics, lack of clear targets, failure to capture socio-ecological impacts at different scales and failure to meet the interest of the target audience. Hence, they do not facilitate effective measurement of progress towards sustainable energy development for individual nations. Important issues relating to energy affordability and equity, environmental sustainability, efficiency, energy security and renewables are neglected by the indicators in all cases, although it should be said that the IAEA indicators are more comprehensive in their coverage of energy efficiency, renewables and environmental sustainability. In each case the indicators are at best only partially relevant to the Icelandic case, due to the country's unique energy mix, environment, economic structure and size and standard of living. By identifying their limitations and by examining them in light of criteria for good indicators as recommended by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD), we contribute to the discussion on the value and validity of indicators, indices and frameworks. Knowing the potential pitfalls, we are in a better position to design a more effective measurement tool. We conclude that a more comprehensive, multi-level, context-specific measurement tool would be needed for measuring national energy sustainability in Iceland and would require methods that allow broad public participation.

In many cases, the ambitions of energy projects go beyond mere electricity production and involve issues of energy justice, environmental awareness, and environmental citizenship. However. these aspirations are often forgotten during project assessments, or they fail to include local voices, especially those of women and other marginalized groups. Gender has been given little attention in the energy scholarship and especially during the post-implementation assessment of energy projects due to the belief that energy technologies are gender neutral and beneficial for the whole community. The present study, with a focus on two local energy projects with mixed ownership, challenges this notion. The two case studies are the islands of El Hierro in Spain and Tilos in Greece. A detailed survey based on a series of indicators drawn from the energy justice framework is used to evaluate women's perceptions. By following a feminist approach, this work draws attention on the difference experiences of women and how these are often not acknowledged during the assessment of renewable energy projects.

In many cases, the ambitions of energy projects go beyond mere electricity production and involve issues of energy justice, environmental awareness, and environmental citizenship. However. these aspirations are often forgotten during project assessments, or they fail to include local voices, especially those of women and other marginalized groups. Gender has been given little attention in the energy scholarship and especially during the post-implementation assessment of energy projects due to the belief that energy technologies are gender neutral and beneficial for the whole community. The present study, with a focus on two local energy projects with mixed ownership, challenges this notion. The two case studies are the islands of El Hierro in Spain and Tilos in Greece. A detailed survey based on a series of indicators drawn from the energy justice framework is used to evaluate women's perceptions. By following a feminist approach, this work draws attention on the difference experiences of women and how these are often not acknowledged during the assessment of renewable energy projects.

The development of mini-and micro-grids has opened up new opportunities for electricity access by offering flexibility in deployment, the potential for more localized control, and greater versatility in financing options. When powered by renewable energy, these systems offer the additional benefit of environmental gains.

Second, labor will continue to migrate from rural to urban areas with the transformation of the economic structure and the urbanization rate will further increase, reaching a maximum of around 70%. The reduction of the rural population will bring new opportunities for the modernization of agriculture, increasing the income of rural residents and realizing the equitable development between urban and rural areas. Third, the income gap among urban residents will widen due to the different level of labor demand for employees with different education levels. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We then connect these three tendencies to political, economic, and technical ideologies of modernism that often provide justifications for energy inequity: (1) top-down political and economic decision-making systems, (2) technical interpretation of sustainability, (3) specialist understanding of fairness, and (4) path dependency in the modern energy paradigm.

As an effort to contribute to expanding the research agenda of energy justice problems, we propose a new understanding of the production of energy injustice by characterizing three institutionalized tendencies of dominant modern energy systems: (1) preference for large-scale technical systems and distancing of system designs from local decision-making processes, (2) centralization of energy production and concomitant distancing of supply from users, and (3) widespread 'risk-taking' tendencies portrayed by designers and proponents of current energy supply systems as a necessary 'price to pay' for technological innovation and social progress. We then connect these three tendencies to political, economic, and technical ideologies of modernism that often provide justifications for energy inequity: (1) top-down political and economic decision-making systems, (2) technical interpretation of sustainability, (3) specialist understanding of fairness, and (4) path dependency in the modern energy paradigm. Finally, we present an illustration of how this new conception of systemic energy injustice can be applied in practice using the case of South Korea's nuclear power system and Seoul's One Less Nuclear Power Plant Initiative.",11.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,1.0,0.0,24.0,24.0,0,243,0.0987654320987654,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,True,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,9.0,5.0,True,True,False

Governments in emerging economies are often faced with the challenge of increasing access to electricity and reducing system inequality, while operating under severe budget constraints. This paper develops a methodology for finding the optimal expansion of a power system under the objective of maximizing social benefit, as it relates to distributional equality for electricity access, subject to a budget constraint. This contrasts with traditional models, which minimize the cost of satisfying projected electricity demand. We formulate a generation expansion planning problem as a utility-maximization mixed-integer linear program and apply it to a case study analysis of a low-income country with limited electricity infrastructure. We focus our analysis on understanding how the optimal allocation of generation between centralized and distributed resources is impacted by stakeholder preferences toward equality and different budget levels. We find that a high preference for equality leads to lower overall electricity consumption levels, but improved electrification rates due to greater investment (300-750 km increase) in transmission infrastructure.

Governments in emerging economies are often faced with the challenge of increasing access to electricity and reducing system inequality, while operating under severe budget constraints. This paper develops a methodology for finding the optimal expansion of a power system under the objective of maximizing social benefit, as it relates to distributional equality for electricity access, subject to a budget constraint. This contrasts with traditional models, which minimize the cost of satisfying projected electricity demand. We formulate a generation expansion planning problem as a utility-maximization mixed-integer linear program and apply it to a case study analysis of a low-income country with limited electricity infrastructure. We focus our analysis on understanding how the optimal allocation of generation between centralized and distributed resources is impacted by stakeholder preferences toward equality and different budget levels. We find that a high preference for equality leads to lower overall electricity consumption levels, but improved electrification rates due to greater investment (300-750 km increase) in transmission infrastructure. If stakeholders move from a low to a high equality preference then they could see a 72-87% increase in energy access equality rating depending on the budget. Conversely, indifference to equality leads to higher overall consumption levels in urban areas but reduced electrification rates.

It also highlights strategies that are helping to bridge the gap by making it easier for residents in cold climate, petroleum-dependent states-those with high thermal energy burdens-to increase comfort and safety in their homes while also reducing energy bills. The barriers to rural energy efficiency identified in this paper have been grouped into three categories: geographic barriers, financial barriers, and awareness and access barriers. There are many differences between rural areas across the country, e.g., demographics, utility model and rate structures, energy sources, and consumption patterns. This paper is not intended to suggest that the strategies documented here will necessarily be applicable to all rural areas in the USA",19.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,31.0,31.0,0,338,0.0917159763313609,True,True,True,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,True,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,9.0,5.0,True,False,False

We employ a capacity expansion model with integrated assessment of climate and health damages, comparing portfolios optimized for benefits to climate alone or both health and climate. The model estimates county-level health damages and accounts for uncertainty by using a range of air quality models (AP3, EASIUR, and InMAP) and concentration-response functions (American Cancer Society and Harvard Six Cities). We find that reducing CO2 by 30% yields $21-68 billion in annual health benefits, with an additional $9-36 billion possible when co-optimizing for climate and health benefits.

This fact is also partly reflected in two United Nations (UN) processes: on the one hand, the Paris Agreement of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change under which countries agreed to hold the increase in the global average temperature to below 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels and, on the other hand, the UN's Sustainable Development Goals aiming to end poverty. These agreements are seen as important foundation to put the world nations on a sustainable pathway. However, how these agreements can be achieved or whether they are even mutually compatible is less clear. We explore the global carbon inequality between and within countries and the carbon implications of poverty alleviation by combining detailed consumer expenditure surveys for different income categories for a wide range of countries with an environmentally extended multi-regional input-output approach to estimate carbon footprints of different household groups, globally, and assess the carbon implications of moving the poorest people out of poverty.

This fact is also partly reflected in two United Nations (UN) processes: on the one hand, the Paris Agreement of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change under which countries agreed to hold the increase in the global average temperature to below 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels and, on the other hand, the UN's Sustainable Development Goals aiming to end poverty. These agreements are seen as important foundation to put the world nations on a sustainable pathway. However, how these agreements can be achieved or whether they are even mutually compatible is less clear. We explore the global carbon inequality between and within countries and the carbon implications of poverty alleviation by combining detailed consumer expenditure surveys for different income categories for a wide range of countries with an environmentally extended multi-regional input-output approach to estimate carbon footprints of different household groups, globally, and assess the carbon implications of moving the poorest people out of poverty.

First, the number of unemployed people in energy-intensive industries such as coal and construction will continue to increase; by 2050, employment in the coal industry will decline by 75%.

We observe that biodiversity loss is driven by other planetary boundaries (land-use change and freshwater use), but also a social foundation (jobs, measured as vulnerable employment). The planetary boundaries of freshwater use and land use are also related: freshwater use is higher in urban centres than in rural areas. The planetary boundary of climate change is also related to land use (the extent of agricultural lands), and the social foundation of income per capita (greater income, higher carbon dioxide emissions). We also find that several social foundations are themselves interrelated. For example gender equality (measured as female participation in the work force) is mainly predicted by vulnerable employment. Also, food deficit increases with poverty level, but is alleviated by access to clean water. Education (literacy rate) and social equity (social insurance) can both lift people out of poverty. These inter-relations suggest that both synergies and trade-offs exist between and within boundaries and foundations. We provide a new conceptual framework that moves us away from the doughnut approach towards one that can begin to address the complex interactions that sustainability scientists and policy makers face when trying to maintain multiple social foundations while not compromising any of the planetary boundaries. We illustrate several hypothesis-based relationships here, to suggest that everything is not related to everything else.

First, the global difference principle asserts that resources should be distributed to maximize the condition of the least well-off humans.

The analysis shows that particularly the socio-economic disparities caused by the deployment of the smart electricity grid are alarming. Affordable policies are currently limited, but the impact in terms of social acceptance may be large.",2.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,17.0,17.0,0,219,0.0776255707762557,True,True,True,True,False,True,False,True,False,False,True,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,6.0,5.0,True,False,False

Government-sponsored programs exist for low-income households while traditional financing serves creditworthy households. However, there remains a coverage gap for those with moderate incomes too high to qualify for low-income programs, but without access to friendly capital. With limited research in this space, this study aims to: (1) develop a model to estimate the number of households in the coverage gap; and (2) explore their spatial distribution. For the state of Michigan, we used data from the US Census Bureau and approximately 12,000 green bank loans to estimate the energy efficiency financing coverage gap across the state's 83 counties using a binomial mixed model. We found that credit score and income interacted to largely determine whether an applicant was approved. Households in the highest income quintile achieved a 50% chance of approval with a moderate credit score (662) while those in the lowest needed a very high credit score (715) for the same odds.

Government-sponsored programs exist for low-income households while traditional financing serves creditworthy households. However, there remains a coverage gap for those with moderate incomes too high to qualify for low-income programs, but without access to friendly capital. With limited research in this space, this study aims to: (1) develop a model to estimate the number of households in the coverage gap; and (2) explore their spatial distribution. For the state of Michigan, we used data from the US Census Bureau and approximately 12,000 green bank loans to estimate the energy efficiency financing coverage gap across the state's 83 counties using a binomial mixed model. We found that credit score and income interacted to largely determine whether an applicant was approved. Households in the highest income quintile achieved a 50% chance of approval with a moderate credit score (662) while those in the lowest needed a very high credit score (715) for the same odds.

Australia also expects to follow the international pathways to implement a climate change policy to curb its greenhouse gas emissions. In this context, the former Labor Government in Australia intended to switch its carbon tax policy to an emissions trading scheme (ETS) after 2 years of its initial operation to achieve an emission target of 5 per cent below the 2000 level by 2020. By employing a computable general equilibrium model and a social accounting matrix database, this article analyses the potential impacts of an ETS with various revenue recycling options on Australian households. Results show that an emission permit price of A$20 per tonne of CO2-e would help Australia to achieve the 2020 emission reduction target. This permit price is likely to have a small contraction in Australia's real GDP (i.e. about 0.3 per cent) and in real household consumption (i.e. about 0.19 per cent).

Australia also expects to follow the international pathways to implement a climate change policy to curb its greenhouse gas emissions. In this context, the former Labor Government in Australia intended to switch its carbon tax policy to an emissions trading scheme (ETS) after 2 years of its initial operation to achieve an emission target of 5 per cent below the 2000 level by 2020. By employing a computable general equilibrium model and a social accounting matrix database, this article analyses the potential impacts of an ETS with various revenue recycling options on Australian households. Results show that an emission permit price of A$20 per tonne of CO2-e would help Australia to achieve the 2020 emission reduction target. This permit price is likely to have a small contraction in Australia's real GDP (i.e. about 0.3 per cent) and in real household consumption (i.e. about 0.19 per cent).

However, the providers also included the municipalities that had the greatest inequities in terms of human development and social inclusion. The importance of evaluating the co-benefits of green-blue infrastructure in urban spaces can serve as an adaptation strategy to both improve natural resource management and offer support to different processes and ecosystem functions. Our study provides a comprehensive understanding of complex urban systems by considering environmental justice and nexus synergies. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Against this backdrop, several studies have been conducted, mostly in developed countries, on sustainability in construction projects. However, efforts at investigating sustainability practices in public-private partnership (PPP) infrastructure projects in developing countries have received limited attention. Hence, the purpose of this study is to investigate the incorporation of sustainability practices within the context of Nigeria's PPP infrastructure projects. Design/methodology/approach A questionnaire survey, which targeted four different types of stakeholders, was conducted in this study. These stakeholders included public sector authorities, concessionaires, consultants and banks undertaking PPP infrastructure projects in the Lagos State, Nigeria. The data collected were analyzed using frequency, percentage, mean score, standard deviation (SD) analyses and the Kruskal-Wallis test. Findings The findings of this study revealed that all the respondents are very much aware of sustainability principles and the vast majority of the respondents from the public sector authorities and the consultant organizations confirmed that they have incorporated sustainability requirements into their bidding documents for PPP infrastructure projects. The study revealed sustainability features in the three aspects of sustainability, namely, economic, environmental and social factors. Furthermore, the study revealed the top three-ranked economic factors of sustainability (considered to be the most important factors) were low maintenance costs, whole life costing and supporting the local economy, respectively. Similarly, the study revealed the top three-ranked environmental factors of sustainability were biodiversity, energy use during the operation stage and energy use during the construction stage, respectively. Furthermore, the study further revealed that the top three-ranked social factors of sustainability were the educational aspect, equity between stakeholders and health and safety, respectively.

The results suggest that in general, there is a modest impact of EPC ratings on listing prices, nonetheless it is not homogeneous across housing segments: (1) for the most modern apartments, with state-of-the-art features and active environmental comfort, energy ratings seem to play a null role in the formation of prices; (2) conversely, for the cheapest apartments, apartments boasting the most basic features, and apartments located in low-income areas, the brown discount is enormously significant, potentially depreciating the equity of those who have the least resources to carry out an energy retrofit. These results have implications for the assessment of the EPBD and its Spanish transposition, since a very well-intentioned environmental policy could have potentially harmful social repercussions in the absence of corrective measures.",2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,9.0,9.0,0,225,0.04,True,True,False,False,True,False,True,True,False,True,True,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,8.0,3.0,False,False,False

We develop a new household-level data set on LMI solar lead acquisition, referrals, and adoption to understand the processes through which LMI solar uptake has occurred in California. Then, we develop models to predict two sub-mechanisms in the solar adoption process: whether an otherwise qualified lead becomes lost i.e. non-responsive to outreach and, for existing clients, whether they refer solar to others. For the program analyzed, participants received their solar system at no cost, which deemphasizes economic drivers of solar adoption and could differ from other program experiences. Both models substantially improved the accuracy of prediction relative to a baseline.
