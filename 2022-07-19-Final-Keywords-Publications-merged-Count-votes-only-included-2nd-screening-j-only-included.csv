Drawing on data collected among 71 European RECs, our exploratory research investigates how RECs engage in this social role by improving participatory procedures to enable vulnerable groups' participation and by distributing affordable energy and energy efficiency to vulnerable households. Using the energy justice framework, we explore how RECs resonate with the three energy justice tenets (distributive, recognitional and procedural) by addressing underrepresented groups and energy poverty.",20.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,44.0,44.0,0,212,0.2075471698113207,True,True,True,True,True,True,False,False,True,False,True,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,6.0,5.0,False,False,False

Our results indicate that the high inequality in overall household energy footprints in China in 2017 was mainly from the high inequality in natural gas footprints (0.476) and the high inequality in household energy footprints in undeveloped provinces.

The Energy Justice Metric (EJM) quantifies energy justice through analyzing the energy justice performance of different countries utilising data from international institutions and national governments. This paper identifies why there is a need for a modeling tool such as the EJM which focuses on the full energy life-cycle and also has a distributive (inequality-correcting) oriented approach. The EJM demonstrates how a country can achieve an improved balance between the three competing aims of the energy trilemma, i.e. economics, politics and the environment.

The Energy Justice Metric (EJM) quantifies energy justice through analyzing the energy justice performance of different countries utilising data from international institutions and national governments. This paper identifies why there is a need for a modeling tool such as the EJM which focuses on the full energy life-cycle and also has a distributive (inequality-correcting) oriented approach. The EJM demonstrates how a country can achieve an improved balance between the three competing aims of the energy trilemma, i.e. economics, politics and the environment.

Our conclusion signals the need for greater critical engagement with how intersecting inequalities are coded into the cultural politics of coal, and how this shapes efforts to pursue a just transition.",2.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,16.0,16.0,0,174,0.0919540229885057,True,True,True,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,True,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,5.0,False,False,False

PEDs are expected to adopt a more human-centric perspective in order to create more liveable and sustainable urban neighbourhoods.

By comparing different distribution policies, we find that the combination of targeted subsidies for unemployed coal workers and direct household subsidies based on proportional per capita will reduce the social income gap to the greatest extent compared with other scenarios. By 2050, this distribution policy will reduce the Gini coefficient in China by 10% compared to the Business as Usual (BAU) scenario.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,22.0,22.0,0,262,0.0839694656488549,True,True,True,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,True,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,True,False,False

To achieve sustainable energy systems, such concerns should be taken into account in the development of smart grid technologies. In this paper, we show that many concerns are related to moral values such as privacy, justice, or trust. We explore the effect of moral values on the acceptance of smart grid technologies. The results of our systematic literature review indicate that moral values can be both driving forces and barriers for smart grid acceptance.

Energy security arose as a problem of the oil crises of the 1970s, and it has become a matter of national security, although its definition depends on geographical location, natural resource endowment, international relations, political system, economic disposition, and ideological perceptions. Although there is no universally accepted definition of energy security, a succinct way to approach it is through the four As: availability, affordability, accessibility (to all), and acceptability (from a sustainability standpoint). Energy security may be measured by numerous indicators, with no single accepted methodology being ideal for all historical and geopolitical circumstances. Dimensions of the concept of energy security include: the environment, technology, demand side management, sociocultural and political factors, human security, geopolitical considerations, and the formulation of energy security policy. Alternatively, energy security may be considered to have five dimensions that may be broken down into 20 components, as follows: (a) availability, i.e. security of supply and production, dependency, and diversification; (b) affordability, i.e. price stability, access and equity, decentralization, and low prices; (c) technology development, i.e. innovation and research, safety and reliability, resilience, energy efficiency, and investment; (d) sustainability (environmental component), i.e. land use, water, climate change, and air pollution; and (e) regulation, i.e. governance, trade, competition, and knowledge of sound regulation. Energy security contains multiple components, including: geography, nuclear energy, economy, society, environment policy and political institutions.

Although there is no universally accepted definition of energy security, a succinct way to approach it is through the four As: availability, affordability, accessibility (to all), and acceptability (from a sustainability standpoint). Energy security may be measured by numerous indicators, with no single accepted methodology being ideal for all historical and geopolitical circumstances. Dimensions of the concept of energy security include: the environment, technology, demand side management, sociocultural and political factors, human security, geopolitical considerations, and the formulation of energy security policy. Alternatively, energy security may be considered to have five dimensions that may be broken down into 20 components, as follows: (a) availability, i.e. security of supply and production, dependency, and diversification; (b) affordability, i.e. price stability, access and equity, decentralization, and low prices; (c) technology development, i.e. innovation and research, safety and reliability, resilience, energy efficiency, and investment; (d) sustainability (environmental component), i.e. land use, water, climate change, and air pollution; and (e) regulation, i.e. governance, trade, competition, and knowledge of sound regulation. Energy security contains multiple components, including: geography, nuclear energy, economy, society, environment policy and political institutions. There are many energy security indicators and indexes that include different dimensions and attributes, such as the Herfindahl-Hirschmann Index, the Oil Vulnerability Index, the Vulnerability Index, the Aggregated Energy Security Performance Indicator, the US Energy Security Risk Index, the Energy Architecture Performance Index, and the Energy Trilemma (or Sustainability) Index.

On the contrary, drawing on literatures from spatial justice and political ecology, including on authoritarian populism, this article analyzes the rise and fall of the solar industry and the associated failures of green industrialization in Bitterfeld, East Germany-an area that is characterized by political, economic, and social peripheralization, marginalization, and the rise of the far right. The development of solar energy, we argue, is merely the latest iteration of an industrial growth model that is rooted in a similar modernist mode of development. Based on original mixed methods field research in eastern Germany, it argues that many of the same inequalities that characterize fossil fuels and gray (de)industrialization-undemocratic and unsustainable industrial processes, the concentration of corporate power and profits, and externalized waste and pollution-are replicated by solar energy. What is distinct is the fact that such contemporary green manufacturing processes appear to negatively affect a wider and more dispersed range of spatial locations, also denying these locales the benefits of accumulation, production, and consumption. This unevenness reflects the reconfiguration of global supply chains over the past thirty years and the nature of green production processes that depend on a wider range of inputs that invariably produce localized sacrifice zones.

On the contrary, drawing on literatures from spatial justice and political ecology, including on authoritarian populism, this article analyzes the rise and fall of the solar industry and the associated failures of green industrialization in Bitterfeld, East Germany-an area that is characterized by political, economic, and social peripheralization, marginalization, and the rise of the far right. The development of solar energy, we argue, is merely the latest iteration of an industrial growth model that is rooted in a similar modernist mode of development. Based on original mixed methods field research in eastern Germany, it argues that many of the same inequalities that characterize fossil fuels and gray (de)industrialization-undemocratic and unsustainable industrial processes, the concentration of corporate power and profits, and externalized waste and pollution-are replicated by solar energy. What is distinct is the fact that such contemporary green manufacturing processes appear to negatively affect a wider and more dispersed range of spatial locations, also denying these locales the benefits of accumulation, production, and consumption. This unevenness reflects the reconfiguration of global supply chains over the past thirty years and the nature of green production processes that depend on a wider range of inputs that invariably produce localized sacrifice zones. We offer a spatial justice framework for solar energy, zooming in at the manufacturing stage, to explore the multiple sacrifice zones at the different stages of solar energy.

In this study, we analyzed the environmental injustice issue relationships of the supply and production of water, energy, and food in the Sao Paulo Macrometropolis, Brazil. Its 180 municipalities were compared and categorized into 'losers' and 'winners' based on the urban nexus approach, the proportion of green infrastructure, and human development. We applied a neural network self-organizing map to official publicly available data to obtain clusters of municipalities featuring combinations of 19 indicators. The results showed four clusters with three containing characteristics of receivers (Capital, Hinterland, and Developed Receivers) and one of providers, the latter aggregating municipalities with a strong role in providing water, food, and subsidies for energy generation.

In this study, we analyzed the environmental injustice issue relationships of the supply and production of water, energy, and food in the Sao Paulo Macrometropolis, Brazil. Its 180 municipalities were compared and categorized into 'losers' and 'winners' based on the urban nexus approach, the proportion of green infrastructure, and human development. We applied a neural network self-organizing map to official publicly available data to obtain clusters of municipalities featuring combinations of 19 indicators. The results showed four clusters with three containing characteristics of receivers (Capital, Hinterland, and Developed Receivers) and one of providers, the latter aggregating municipalities with a strong role in providing water, food, and subsidies for energy generation.

Our results suggest that the DR gap is caused less by technology limitations than by the need for financing initiatives, market innovations, infrastructure modernization, and enablers of socio-economic inclusion. By studying a state that lags in DR implementation, other countries and sub-national entities where DR is under-utilized can learn from our findings and methods.",2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,12.0,12.0,0,207,0.0579710144927536,True,True,True,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,True,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,6.0,5.0,False,False,False

Around the world, individuals, communities, organizations, cities, states, and countries are recognizing that renewable energy offers much more than just reliable clean electricity, pollution reductions, and climate mitigation. In addition to these environmental benefits, the renewable energy revolution also provides potential to transform society by redistributing jobs, wealth, health, and political power more equitably. Energy democracy is a growing social movement that prioritizes this potential for redistributing power to the people through renewable transformation. Energy democracy acknowledges how fossil-fuel-based energy systems and the associated massive corporate profits of large multinational energy companies have perpetuated inequities, exacerbated disparate vulnerabilities, and promoted widespread injustices among and within communities around the world. By highlighting the negative societal impacts of fossil-fuel-based concentration of power and wealth, the principles of energy democracy connect energy system change with an associated transformation toward a more socially just and equal society. Energy democracy recognizes that replacing fossil-fuel-based infrastructure with renewables is much more than a technological substitution; the social changes associated with this transition could be transformative. Energy democracy focuses on harnessing this progressive social change potential by embracing a vision of more distributed, locally based energy systems with a regionally appropriate mix of different renewable sources satisfying 100% of society's energy needs. Whether the renewable energy transition delivers on this potential of redistributing power depends, however, on how renewable energy is deployed, and who is included and excluded in the benefits of a renewable-based society. The energy democracy vision, therefore, provides a valuable lens to guide participation, governance, and priorities of the renewable energy revolution. Advancing the vision of the energy democracy movement requires prioritizing local and community-controlled renewables and scaling-up and mainstreaming cooperative-model, publicly owned energy infrastructure.",,,,,,,,,43,0,0,0.0,4,0,43,,,0013-9157,1939-9154,,WOS:000458554100002,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1,,True,True,True,True,False,True,False,True,True,False,True,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,5.0,False,False,False
