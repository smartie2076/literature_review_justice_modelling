The geographical focus is on the Nordic-Baltic energy region and the technological focus is on onshore wind power and power transmission, which are considered key technologies in achieving carbon-neutral energy systems in northern Europe. We combine qualitative analysis of social acceptance with quantitative assessments of scenarios using techno-economic energy-system modelling. Key factors in and consequences of social acceptance are identified, especially environmental, health, and distributional factors, as well as costs for developers and society. The energy system analysis includes four scenarios illustrating the system effects and costs of low social acceptance. The results indicate that if low social acceptance were to restrict investments in onshore wind power, costlier solar photovoltaics and offshore wind power would step in.

The geographical focus is on the Nordic-Baltic energy region and the technological focus is on onshore wind power and power transmission, which are considered key technologies in achieving carbon-neutral energy systems in northern Europe. We combine qualitative analysis of social acceptance with quantitative assessments of scenarios using techno-economic energy-system modelling. Key factors in and consequences of social acceptance are identified, especially environmental, health, and distributional factors, as well as costs for developers and society. The energy system analysis includes four scenarios illustrating the system effects and costs of low social acceptance.

Using data from the California electricity market, I develop a model to illustrate the interaction between large-scale renewable energy policies (carbon taxes, feed-in tariffs, and renewable portfolio standards) and their pricing to final consumers under alternative retail pricing schemes (no pass-through, marginal fees, fixed flat tariffs, and Ramsey pricing). I focus on the trade-off between charging residential versus industrial consumers to highlight tensions between efficiency, distributional, and environmental goals.",3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,21.0,21.0,0,157,0.1337579617834395,True,True,True,True,True,True,False,False,True,True,True,5.0,False,False,True,,,2.0,5,False,False,4.0,5.0,3.0,12.0,False,0.0,False,0.0,False,0.0,False,False,0.0,0.0,True,12.0,True,12.0,"Reguant, Mar",The Efficiency and Sectoral Distributional Impacts of Large-Scale Renewable Energy Policies,2019.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,False,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,False,Martha

More sustainable heating systems are required in city districts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, these systems may lack social acceptance as they often require significant adjustments to homes and may lead to a noticeable loss of in-home thermal comfort. Predicting social acceptance is often difficult due to the long-term planning horizon for energy systems. It is therefore unclear which design requirements and policy guidelines need to be specified ex ante. We suggest an approach to anticipate social acceptance by identifying value conflicts embedded in sustainable heating systems in specific social settings. These value conflicts might cause a lack of social acceptance over time due to value change. We demonstrate this approach using a case of community-driven heating initiative in The Hague, the Netherlands. We identify value conflicts embedded in various sustainable heating systems using an agent-based model.

More sustainable heating systems are required in city districts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, these systems may lack social acceptance as they often require significant adjustments to homes and may lead to a noticeable loss of in-home thermal comfort. Predicting social acceptance is often difficult due to the long-term planning horizon for energy systems. It is therefore unclear which design requirements and policy guidelines need to be specified ex ante. We suggest an approach to anticipate social acceptance by identifying value conflicts embedded in sustainable heating systems in specific social settings. These value conflicts might cause a lack of social acceptance over time due to value change. We demonstrate this approach using a case of community-driven heating initiative in The Hague, the Netherlands. We identify value conflicts embedded in various sustainable heating systems using an agent-based model.

To address this question, this study develops four indicators from existing energy justice frameworks and applies them to a range of demand-side innovations offered to energy users in Ontario. The indicators are used to assess innovation availability, affordability, information, and involvement. Innovations were identified using surveys and desk research across Ontario's energy technology innovation system (ETIS).

Findings suggest that three of the four indicators-availability, affordability and information are broadly being addressed, while involvement was more difficult to establish.

Furthermore, government-delivered, publicly owned or regulated innovation providers place a greater emphasis on energy justice, including the provision of innovations for marginalized actors. This study aids our understanding of energy justice in low-carbon energy innovations and is critical given that in the context of funding cuts to public services, there may be an increased reliance on decentralized actors. The consideration of justice gaps that emerge through such decentralization should not be overlooked. Our findings suggest that within Ontario's ETIS, who provides innovations matters.

The consideration of justice gaps that emerge through such decentralization should not be overlooked. Our findings suggest that within Ontario's ETIS, who provides innovations matters. Given the insights presented in this study, this research approach and the developed indicators could be applied to other contexts and socio-technical systems.

In this way, the study extrapolates how energy justice issues co-relate with social-ecological inequities, and at the same time present risks for the future of the comarca, with implications for broader contexts.",9.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,24.0,24.0,0,209,0.1148325358851674,True,True,True,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,True,4.0,False,False,True,1.0,,5.0,5,False,False,4.0,2.0,5.0,11.0,True,0.0,False,0.0,False,0.0,False,False,0.0,0.0,True,11.0,True,11.0,"Hampl, Nora",Consume less or grow sustainably?

The implementation of European and national targets for wind energy expansion is, however, challenged by technical, environmental, economic and social acceptance aspects. Further research on wind power expansion is compelled due to dynamic aspects such as land-use fluctuations, evolution of wind turbine technology, associated cost, and other factors. For that reason, a systematic approach for exploring future scenarios of onshore wind power development under techno-economic aspects and quantitative aspects of social acceptance (distributive justice and regulatory framework) was developed. The model was developed in Python, PostgreSQL and SQliteDB and encompasses a high-resolution GIS-based assessment of potential locations for wind turbines.

The implementation of European and national targets for wind energy expansion is, however, challenged by technical, environmental, economic and social acceptance aspects. Further research on wind power expansion is compelled due to dynamic aspects such as land-use fluctuations, evolution of wind turbine technology, associated cost, and other factors. For that reason, a systematic approach for exploring future scenarios of onshore wind power development under techno-economic aspects and quantitative aspects of social acceptance (distributive justice and regulatory framework) was developed. The model was developed in Python, PostgreSQL and SQliteDB and encompasses a high-resolution GIS-based assessment of potential locations for wind turbines.

But, this requirement implies technological choices based on a sustainable measurement of their impacts on the ecological and economical contexts. So, social and economic requirements must also be taken into account by the decision-makers. Bioeconomy can represent a possible approach to deal with the requirements of the present time. But, new needs emerge in relation to sustainability. So, sustainable policies require new indicators, in order to consider the link among economics, technologies, and social well-being. In this paper, an irreversible thermodynamic approach is developed, in order to introduce a thermoeconomic indicator, based on thermodynamic optimization methods, but also on socioeconomic and ecological evaluations. The entropy production rate is introduced in relation to the CO2 emission flows from human activities, and it is related to the income index, in order to consider the economic and social equity. This approach is of interest of the researchers in the field of econophysics, thermoeconomy, economics, and bioeconomy.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,22.0,22.0,0,249,0.0883534136546184,True,False,True,False,True,True,False,True,False,False,True,5.0,False,False,True,2.0,,6.0,5.0,False,False,5.0,2.0,2.0,9.0,True,0.0,False,0.0,False,0.0,False,False,0.0,0.0,True,9.0,True,9.0,"Lucia, Umberto; Grisolia, Giulia",Irreversible Thermodynamics and Bioeconomy: Toward a Human-Oriented Sustainability,2021.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,False,2.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,False,Any

Given the current context, increasing income leads to increasing carbon footprints and makes global targets for mitigating greenhouse gases more difficult to achieve given the pace of technological progress and current levels of fossil fuel dependence.

This fact is also partly reflected in two United Nations (UN) processes: on the one hand, the Paris Agreement of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change under which countries agreed to hold the increase in the global average temperature to below 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels and, on the other hand, the UN's Sustainable Development Goals aiming to end poverty. These agreements are seen as important foundation to put the world nations on a sustainable pathway. However, how these agreements can be achieved or whether they are even mutually compatible is less clear. We explore the global carbon inequality between and within countries and the carbon implications of poverty alleviation by combining detailed consumer expenditure surveys for different income categories for a wide range of countries with an environmentally extended multi-regional input-output approach to estimate carbon footprints of different household groups, globally, and assess the carbon implications of moving the poorest people out of poverty. Given the current context, increasing income leads to increasing carbon footprints and makes global targets for mitigating greenhouse gases more difficult to achieve given the pace of technological progress and current levels of fossil fuel dependence.

We develop a statistical model to investigate relationships among and between the planetary boundaries and social foundations of the sustainability 'doughnut' model. We find over 35 direct and indirect, positive and negative, influences of varying magnitude among seven boundaries (biodiversity loss, climate change, ocean acidification, land use, nitrogen and phosphorus cycles, atmospheric aerosol loading and freshwater use) and eleven foundations (energy, income, health, education, food, water, gender equality, resilience, jobs, voice and social equity). We observe that biodiversity loss is driven by other planetary boundaries (land-use change and freshwater use), but also a social foundation (jobs, measured as vulnerable employment). The planetary boundaries of freshwater use and land use are also related: freshwater use is higher in urban centres than in rural areas. The planetary boundary of climate change is also related to land use (the extent of agricultural lands), and the social foundation of income per capita (greater income, higher carbon dioxide emissions). We also find that several social foundations are themselves interrelated. For example gender equality (measured as female participation in the work force) is mainly predicted by vulnerable employment. Also, food deficit increases with poverty level, but is alleviated by access to clean water. Education (literacy rate) and social equity (social insurance) can both lift people out of poverty.

However, a knowledge gap still remains between this concept and policy discussion at a practical level. Therefore, using the existing scenarios of decarbonisation of the power sector and employment factors for the power sector based on extended input-output tables, this study analysed Just Transition issues, looking at the concept from three aspects: distributional justice to identify key impacts by location and economic sector; recognition justice to assess key inequalities; and procedural justice which deal with fair process and possible measures to enhance acceptability of climate policies. The results of this study show that achieving decarbonisation of the power sector provides a net increase in domestic employment and supplies stable jobs in rural areas, thereby contributing to the revitalisation of the local economy.

Therefore, using the existing scenarios of decarbonisation of the power sector and employment factors for the power sector based on extended input-output tables, this study analysed Just Transition issues, looking at the concept from three aspects: distributional justice to identify key impacts by location and economic sector; recognition justice to assess key inequalities; and procedural justice which deal with fair process and possible measures to enhance acceptability of climate policies.

This may be the cause of debates, especially in buildings with central heating, when heat costs are shared among tenants by means of sub-metering systems. In this paper, authors address this issue by studying the heat thefts phenomenon in dynamic conditions in a low-insulated building, when the heating system is used unevenly by the tenants (i.e., with different temperatures and/or use). To this end, a social housing building located in Mediterranean climate, where daily temperature excursions and solar heat gains enhance the dynamics of the heat flows, has been chosen as the case-study.

Dwellings with favorable positions can have significant benefit, also when heated for a limited number of hours, if compared to apartments located in disadvantaged positions (i.e., upper or lower floors or north-oriented). This may be the cause of debates, especially in buildings with central heating, when heat costs are shared among tenants by means of sub-metering systems. In this paper, authors address this issue by studying the heat thefts phenomenon in dynamic conditions in a low-insulated building, when the heating system is used unevenly by the tenants (i.e., with different temperatures and/or use). To this end, a social housing building located in Mediterranean climate, where daily temperature excursions and solar heat gains enhance the dynamics of the heat flows, has been chosen as the case-study.

To achieve sustainable development, it is necessary to resolve these issues.Purpose of the article: To shed light on the impact of income inequality on CO2 emissions based on Russian regional data covering the years 2004-2018.Methods: Gini index and decile dispersion ratio are used to measure income inequality. To study the impact of income inequality on CO2 emissions in the Russian regions, we estimate econometric models with fixed and random effects and apply GMM method. We test the hypothesis of the environmental Kuznets curve to determine the impact of economic growth on CO2 emissions.Findings & value added: The results show that CO2 emissions increase in tandem with growth in income inequality between 10% of people with the lowest income and 10% of people with the highest income. Simultaneously, CO2 emissions decrease with growth of Gini coefficient. The hypothesis of the Environmental Kuznets Curve was confirmed based on GMM method. Our findings underscore that the activities of the extraction and manufacturing sectors, as well as energy consumption, increase CO2 emissions.

To achieve sustainable development, it is necessary to resolve these issues.Purpose of the article: To shed light on the impact of income inequality on CO2 emissions based on Russian regional data covering the years 2004-2018.Methods: Gini index and decile dispersion ratio are used to measure income inequality. To study the impact of income inequality on CO2 emissions in the Russian regions, we estimate econometric models with fixed and random effects and apply GMM method. We test the hypothesis of the environmental Kuznets curve to determine the impact of economic growth on CO2 emissions.Findings & value added: The results show that CO2 emissions increase in tandem with growth in income inequality between 10% of people with the lowest income and 10% of people with the highest income. Simultaneously, CO2 emissions decrease with growth of Gini coefficient. The hypothesis of the Environmental Kuznets Curve was confirmed based on GMM method. Our findings underscore that the activities of the extraction and manufacturing sectors, as well as energy consumption, increase CO2 emissions. The chief significance of this paper is the finding that large income gap between extremely rich and extremely poor population cohorts increases CO2 emissions.

Whilst considerable research has focused on the geography of DEP, similar issues of transport-related energy costs have received less attention, reflecting entrenched disciplinary and sectoral boundaries. This is despite transport accounting for a high proportion of household energy consumption and expenditure amongst specific vulnerable populations and locales. Meanwhile, owing to the prevalence of fossil fuels in domestic and transport energy, both are affected by changes in fuel prices. Subsequently, selected households face high expenditure on both domestic and transport energy. Focusing on a case study of England, this paper analyses the geographical distribution of DEP and TEP, and the extent to which the two intersect. Two neighbourhood-scale analyses shed light on the geographies of DEV, using three existing DEP and TEP indicators. Firstly, we identify significant clusters of neighbourhoods with a high or low propensity to DEV using a Local Moran's I statistic. Secondly, we identify neighbourhoods in the highest and lowest quantiles for multiple DEP and TEP indicators.

Whilst considerable research has focused on the geography of DEP, similar issues of transport-related energy costs have received less attention, reflecting entrenched disciplinary and sectoral boundaries. This is despite transport accounting for a high proportion of household energy consumption and expenditure amongst specific vulnerable populations and locales. Meanwhile, owing to the prevalence of fossil fuels in domestic and transport energy, both are affected by changes in fuel prices. Subsequently, selected households face high expenditure on both domestic and transport energy. Focusing on a case study of England, this paper analyses the geographical distribution of DEP and TEP, and the extent to which the two intersect. Two neighbourhood-scale analyses shed light on the geographies of DEV, using three existing DEP and TEP indicators. Firstly, we identify significant clusters of neighbourhoods with a high or low propensity to DEV using a Local Moran's I statistic. Secondly, we identify neighbourhoods in the highest and lowest quantiles for multiple DEP and TEP indicators. Our results illustrate that as many as 6% of neighbourhoods (accounting for 3 million residents) have a high propensity towards DEV depending on the indicators selected, typically concentrating in isolated, rural neighbourhoods.

Electrification increases in these regions, with the increased generation being met by nuclear and renewables. Low-income regions, however, stagnate due to limited economic growth. Growth in total consumption is dominated by increases in population, not increases in per capita consumption. Due to failures in energy access policies, these regions continue to depend on traditional biofuels, leading to high pollutant emissions. Declining dependence on fossil fuels in all regions means that total radiative forcing absent the inclusion of mitigation or impacts only reaches 6.4W m(-2) in 2100, making this a world with relatively low challenges to mitigation.
