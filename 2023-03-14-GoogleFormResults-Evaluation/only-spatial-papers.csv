In the case of market conditions, the only indicators available are the tariffs for the two most commonly used types of energy: gas and electricity. Although from a theoretical perspective their inclusion in the model is essential, in the specific case of the Spanish provinces they do not allow for a distinction to be drawn between units, as tariffs are standard for the entire country. Despite this, we opted to include them, as the proposed model is intended for general application. Access to renewable energies was calculated by determining the percentage of renewable energies over the total energy production in each province. As for the residential environment, the aim was to determine building energy quality. Unfortunately, there is no energy quality indicator for all the homes registered in Spain. Although new constructions are required to meet certain energy efficiency standards [86,87], this variable is not available for all Spanish homes. In light of these circumstances, we decided to apply two proxies: newly built homes, which supposedly meet the aforementioned energy requirements and a home ownership indicator, included under the supposition that home owners are more disposed than lessees to take on major alteration and improvement work, such as energy efficiency improvements [18,20]. When considering the physical environment, annual hours of sunshine were used to calculate luminosity conditions and annual heating degree days for thermal conditions. The “heating degree day” variable reflects the “harshness” of the climate conditions and indicates the energy needs of a specific territory in order to face these conditions. Specifically, this indicator was taken as the annual sum of the positive daily variations between 20 ◦C (which guarantees comfort in the home) and the exterior temperature [66]. A low value for this variable indicates limited heating requirements and outside temperatures averaging around 20 ◦C, whilst a high value indicates elevated heating needs. Finally, in the case of the socio-economic environment, the sub-dimensions discussed in the theoretical background were taken into consideration. Two partial indicators were used in order to approach the incidence of vulnerable population according to the theoretical framework and the availability of data at provincial level. On the one hand, the economically vulnerable population was approached by using the unemployed population in relation to the total population [21]. On the other hand, the demographically vulnerable population (i.e., the population that is particularly sensitive to environmental conditions for biological reasons) was approached by using the over 65s [21] and under 16s, in relation to the total population. Furthermore, per capita production (an average economic capacity for provincial populations) was used to approach the second sub-dimension: the vulnerability gap.","Electricity tariff, Natural gas tariff, Access to renewable energies, Home ownership, New home, Heating degree day, Hours of sunshine, Unemployed, Under 16s and over 65s, Per capita income",,Household Energy Vulnerability Index (HEVI),"The synthetic indicator may adopt positive values for some units and negative values for others. In this sense, the index value will be positive, providing that the weaknesses exceed the strengths, and negative when the strengths exceed the weaknesses. As a result, the higher the synthetic indicator value of a particular region, the greater its household energy vulnerability.","No, but relevat content",Household Energy Vulnerability Index (HEVI) - A tool designed to quantify the abstract and multidimensional phenomenon of household energy vulnerability,,,Houseownership and rent;Building conditions;Age;Occupation;Income;Average consumer,,"Electricity tariff, Natural gas tariff, Access to renewable energies, Home ownership, New home, Heating degree day, Hours of sunshine, Unemployed, Under 16s and over 65s, Per capita income",,,,DISTRIBUTIONAL JUSTICE: Distribution of benefits from the energy sector and also the negatives.
